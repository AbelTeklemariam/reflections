How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	by differenciating the lines that was added and/or removed and by specifying 
	the lines where the changes were made it became easy to detect if there were changes
	or bugs in the code
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it can help in keeping track of the changes made in the entire project and
	fix any unnoticed errorst that might occur by comparring the cheanges made 
	between two versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
	keep track of the specific changes by choosing when to save 
	
	cons
	might save to early which creates too many commits or might save to late and 
	make the commits huge and harder to specify where the changes are made

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    so the changes in each files can be save in their respective files without the
	need to save each file separately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
    git log retrives all the commits made in the projects with specific ids and git diff
	presents the differece between two commits having separate ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   since it git lets commenting on the commits it removes the hectic work of 
   finding the error in the whole project where it can be found easily by
   comparing two commit ids and confidently make changes to a specific commit 
   without threathening the integrity of the whole project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  with git and using the version control behavior of git i will use it to colloborate
  on difcerent projects with different people
